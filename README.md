# Flask app: Actors

This app is discussed in detail in the [Flask Forms chapter](https://python-adv-web-apps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/flask_forms.html) of **Python Beginners.**

*actors.py* is the Flask app script.

The templates are using Flask-Bootstrap (v.5) and Flask-WTF.

A live version of this app can be viewed here:

It does not use a database; it uses a simple 100-item data file named *data.py.*

.
